### The technologies used


- An open weather API was used where one would give the weather by submitting the location
-Javascript,Jquery,html, and CSS were used to conduct the execution of this program

---

### The Approach Taken

- I wanted to make a program that can easily tell you the weather from giving a location

- I used the information from the API using ajax in javascript

- Once I was able to make a user interface then I was in a position to stylize the webpage

---

### Unsolved Problems

- There are still bugs to this program for example: what if there two cities named Boston, and I type in Boston what will happen. Which city will show. 
- When I type in Boston,MA it does not work you need to inclue USA as well.

### Future Plans
- What I orginally wanted to do was to ask the user to submit a name of a location or to use google maps embedded on the website to click on the location
- Then that would add the weather of the location on a list
- Before adding the weather on the list maybe I can ask them do you want this on the list
- Also instead of adding it on the list start a carousel that is created  via for loop whenever you a add a weather on list
that randomizes background images of iconc location of the area selected
