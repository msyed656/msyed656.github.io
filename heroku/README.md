# Project 2: Book App

This is my second project which generates a list of books you want to read. Once your done reading with them you can delete from the list.

# Live Website 

https://book-app7863.herokuapp.com/

# Tech. Used 

I used ejs, mongoose, and express. I used these three technologies in order to generate this app. I used ejs to find a develop websites related with each route. I used mongoose to create a schema of the data. I used express to help build the rest of the application.  

The approach that was taken was to find out a simple problem and resolve it via programming. That problem was keeping track of books you have read. 

# Unsolved Problems/ Future prospects

Make a list of what needs to be read as well as what has already been read. (A to do list)

Also add API like google books where you can search for a book and add it to your list.
